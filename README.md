Personal projects on machine learning utilizing kaggle datasets.
 1. K-Means-mall-customers: This project analyzes a dataset containing demographic and financial information of shopping mall customers, including gender, age, annual income, and spending score. The K-Means clustering algorithm is applied to segment customers into distinct groups based on their characteristics.
 2. recipe-traffic: This project is aimed at earning DataCamp certificates and involves analyzing a dataset of recipes intended to drive website traffic. The dataset includes information on each recipe, such as calories, carbohydrates, sugar, protein, category, servings, and a "high_traffic" indicator, which denotes whether the recipe generates significant traffic.Three machine learning models were implemented in this project: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). Additionally, a new key performance indicator (KPI) was developed to evaluate the performance of each model.
 3. shopper-intentions: This project analyzes a dataset on shopper behavior in an online shopping platform to predict whether a customer will complete a purchase. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) model is used for prediction, and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied as a dimensionality reduction technique to visualize the decision boundary.
